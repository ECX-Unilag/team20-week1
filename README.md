Project Description:
Census Management System is a system designed to automate collection, sorting, aggregation and presentation of the population data across a region.
-ASSUMPTIONS MADE-
1. We assumed that the project is for country Nigeria
2. Data collection was based on homes/families
3. We worked with the three major languages in Nigeria (Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba)

-STEPS TAKEN-
1. A design was made available for implemtation.
2. A Nodejs and MongoDB API was built that controls the logic side of the project, so that the MOBILE and WEB version would have a common database.
3. The frontend was built using React.js


-HOW IT WORKS-
1. Families in the country can access the website/mobile app and then upload their family data `(Family name, number in family, Native language, State of residence)`.
2. The API processes these information and sorts the data with respect to `states`. 
3. The admin logs on with the credentials and gets a comprehensive data of the population.
